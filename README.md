fiqrogue
========

FIQRogue is intended to be an experimental roguelike for learning purposes and to gain the experience of writing a C project entirely from scratch, rather than just working on already existing projects.

Dependecies for building
========================

You will need Perl and a C compiler to be able to build the code


Building
========

General
-------

You can try out the application by doing the following.

Linux/Mac
---------

Run the following commands in a shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/FredrIQ/fiqrogue.git # clone the repository
    $ cd fiqrogue
    $ mkdir build # create a build repository
    $ cd build
    $ ../aimake -i /path/to/installdir

Where installdir is where you want to install the application. Once you're done,
you can run the resulting fiqrogue binary.


Windows
-------

I don't own a Windows desktop. Sorry (TODO).
